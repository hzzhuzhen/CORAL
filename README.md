# CORAL Project
The CORAL project is structured into two main modules:

### Interaction Module:

- Backend: Utilizes Java and MySQL for server-side operations and database management.
- Frontend: Built with CSS, HTML, and Vue.js for a dynamic user interface.

### Model Module:

- LLM Labeling: Focuses on large language model (LLM) labeling tasks.
- SLM Filter: Involves small language model (SLM) filtering processes.

Feel free to explore each module for a deeper understanding of the project's architecture and functionalities.
